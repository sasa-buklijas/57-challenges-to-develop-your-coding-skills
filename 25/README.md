Functions help you abstract away complex operations, but they also help you build reusable components.
Create a program that determines the complexity of a given password based on these rules:

* A very weak password contains only numbers and is fewer than eight characters.  * A weak password contains only letters and is fewer than eight characters.  * A strong password contains letters and at least one number and is at least eight characters.  * A very strong password contains letters, numbers, and special characters and is at least eight characters.

**Example Output**  
The password '12345' is a very weak password.  The password 'abcdef' is a weak password.  The password 'abc123xyz' is a strong password.  The password '1337h@xor!' is a very strong password.
