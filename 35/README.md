Arrays donâ€™t have to be hard-coded.   
You can take user input and store it in an array and then work with it.  

Create a program that picks a winner for a contest or prize drawing.  
Prompt for names of contestants until the user leaves the entry blank. Then randomly select a winner.  

**Example Output**  
 
Enter a name: Homer  Enter a name: Bart  Enter a name: Maggie  Enter a name: Lisa  Enter a name: Moe  Enter a name:  The winner is... Maggie.
