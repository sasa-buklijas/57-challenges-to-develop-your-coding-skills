Arrays are great for storing possible responses from a program.  
If you combine that with a random number generator, you can pick a random entry from this list, which works great for games.

Create a Magic 8 Ball game that prompts for a question and then displays either “Yes,” “No,” “Maybe,” or “Ask again later.”

**Example Output**  
 
What's your question?  Will I be rich and famous?  
Ask again later.
