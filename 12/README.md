Computing simple interest is a great way to quickly figure out whether an investment has value.  
Itâ€™s also a good way to get comfortable with explicitly coding the order of operations in your programs.
Create a program that computes simple interest.  
Prompt for the principal amount, the rate as a percentage, and the time, and display the amount accrued (principal + interest).

The formula for simple interest is A = P(1 + rt), where P is the principal amount, r is the annual rate of interest, t is the number of years the amount is invested, and A is the amount at the end of the investment.

**Example Output**  
Enter the principal: 1500  Enter the rate of interest: 4.3  Enter the number of years: 4  

After 4 years at 4.3%, the investment will be worth $1758.
