Sorting records is helpful, but sometimes you need to filter down the results to find or display only what youâ€™re looking for.

Given the following data set  
<pre>
First Name   Last Name   Position            Separation date
John         Johnson     Manager             2016-12-31
Tou          Xiong       Software Engineer   2016-10-05
Michaela     Michaelson  District Manager    2015-12-19
Jake         Jacobson    Programmer
Jacquelyn    Jackson     DBA
Sally        Weber       Web Developer       2015-12-18 
</pre>

create a program that lets a user locate all records that match the search string by comparing the search string to the first or last name field.

**Example Output**
