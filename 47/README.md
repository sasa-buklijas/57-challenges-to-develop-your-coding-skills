Did you know you can find out exactly who’s in space right now? The Open Notify API provides that information.  
Visit http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json to see not only how many people are currently in space but also their names and which spacecraft they’re on.
Create a program that pulls in this data and displays the information from this API in a tabular format.


**Example Output**
