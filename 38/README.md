# From the book:  

Sometimes input you collect will need to be filtered down.  
Data structures and loops can make this process easier.

Create a program that prompts for a list of numbers, separated by spaces.  
Have the program print out a new list containing only the even numbers.

**Example Output**  
 
Enter a list of numbers, separated by spaces:  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  
The even numbers are 2 4 6 8.
