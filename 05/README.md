You’ll often write programs that deal with numbers. And depending on the programming language you use, you’ll have to convert the inputs you get to numerical data types.    Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of those numbers as shown in the example output: 

**Example Output**  
What is the first number? 10  What is the second number? 5  10 + 5 = 15  10 - 5 = 5  10 * 5 = 50  10 / 5 = 2
