# From the book:  
Sometimes data comes in as a structured format that you have to break down and turn into records so you can process them.  
CSV, or comma-separated values, is a common stan- dard for doing this.

Construct a program that reads in the following data file:

<pre>
Ling,Mai,55900Johnson,Jim,56500Jones,Aaron,46000Jones,Chris,34500Swift,Geoffrey,14200Xiong,Fong,65000Zarnecki,Sabrina,51500
</pre>

Process the records and display the results formatted as a table, evenly spaced, as shown in the example output.

**Example Output**  

<pre>
Last     First     Salary-------------------------Ling     Mai       55900Johnson  Jim       56500Jones    Aaron     46000Jones    Chris     34500Swift    Geoffrey  14200Xiong    Fong      65000Zarnecki Sabrina   51500
</pre>
