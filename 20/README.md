More complex programs may have decisions nested in other decisions, so that when one decision is made, additional decisions must be made.
Create a tax calculator that handles multiple states and multiple counties within each state.  
The program prompts the user for the order amount and the state where the order will be shipped. 

For Wisconsin residents, prompt for the county of residence.  
* For Eau Claire county residents, add an additional 0.005 tax.* For Dunn county residents,add an additional 0.004 tax.

Illinois residents must be charged 8% sales tax with no additional county-level charge.  
All other states are not charged tax.  
The program then displays the tax and the total for Wisconsin and Illinois residents but just the total for everyone else.

**Example Output**  
What is the order amount? 10  What state do you live in? Wisconsin  The tax is $0.50.  The total is $10.50.
