Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for words.  
You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.  Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.  

**Example Output**  
Enter a noun: dog  Enter a verb: walk  Enter an adjective: blue  Enter an adverb: quickly  Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!
