Passwords are validated by comparing a user-provided value with a known value that’s stored.  
Either it’s correct or it’s not.
  
Create a simple program that validates user login credentials.  
The program must prompt the user for a username and password.  
The program should compare the password given by the user to a known password.  
If the password matches, the program should display “Welcome!” If it doesn’t match, the program should display “I don’t know you.”

**Example Output**  
What is the password? 12345  I don't know you.  OrWhat is the password? abc$123  Welcome!
