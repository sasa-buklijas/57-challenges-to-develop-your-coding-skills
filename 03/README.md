From the book:

Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and end of a string. But sometimes we need to print out the quotation marks themselves by using escape characters.
Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author. Display the quotation and author as shown in the example output.

Example Output
       What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
       Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
       Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids
       you're looking for."
