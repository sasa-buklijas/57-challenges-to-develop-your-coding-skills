# From the book:  
Alphabetizing the contents of a file, or sorting its contents, is a great way to get comfortable manipulating a file in your program.

Create a program that reads in the following list of names:

Given the following data set  

<pre>
Ling, MaiJohnson, JimZarnecki, SabrinaJones, ChrisJones, AaronSwift, GeoffreyXiong, Fong
</pre>

Read this program and sort the list alphabetically.  
Then print the sorted list to a file that looks like the following example output.

**Example Output**  

<pre>
Total of 7 names-----------------Ling, MaiJohnson, JimJones, AaronJones, ChrisSwift, GeoffreyXiong, FongZarnecki, Sabrina
</pre>
