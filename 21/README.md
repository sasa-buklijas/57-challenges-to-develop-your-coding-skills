Many programs display information to the end user in one form but use a different form inside the program.  
For example, you may show the word Blue on the screen, but behind the scenes youâ€™ll have a numerical value for that color or an internal value because you may need to represent the textual description in another language for Spanish speaking visitors.

Write a program that converts a number from 1 to 12 to the corresponding month.  
Prompt for a number and display the corresponding calendar month, with 1 being January and 12 being December.  
For any value outside that range, display an appropriate error message.  

**Example Output**  
Please enter the number of the month: 3  The name of the month is March.
