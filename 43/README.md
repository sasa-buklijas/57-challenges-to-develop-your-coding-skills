# From the book:  
Programming languages can create files and folders too.
Create a program that generates a website skeleton with the following specifications:

* Prompt for the name of the site.  * Prompt for the author of the site.  * Ask if the user wants a folder for JavaScript files.  * Ask if the user wants a folder for CSS files.  * Generate an index.html file that contains the name of the site inside the \<title> tag and the author in a \<meta> tag.  

**Example Output**
