Using functions to abstract the logic away from the rest of your code makes it easier to read and easier to maintain.

Create a program that compares two strings and determines if the two strings are anagrams.  
The program should prompt for both input strings and display the output as shown in the example that follows.

**Example Output**  
Enter two strings and I'll tell you if they are anagrams:  Enter the first string: note  
Enter the second string: tone  "note" and "tone" are anagrams.
