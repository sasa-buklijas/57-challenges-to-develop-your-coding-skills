Coming up with a password that meets specific requirements is something your computer can do.  
And it will give you practice using random number generators in conjunction with a list of known values.

Create a program that generates a secure password.  
Prompt the user for the minimum length, the number of special characters, and the number of numbers.   
Then generate a password for the user using those inputs.

**Example Output**
