Large functions arenâ€™t very usable or maintainable.  
It makes a lot of sense to break down the logic of a program into smaller functions that do one thing each.  
The program can then call these functions in sequence to perform the work. 

Write a program that prompts for a first name, last name, employee ID, and ZIP code.  
Ensure that the input is valid according to these rules: 

* The first name must be filled in.* The last name must be filled in.* The first and last names must be at least two characters long.* An employee ID is in the format AA-1234. So, two letters, a hyphen, and four numbers.* The ZIP code must be a number.

Display appropriate error messages on incorrect data.

**Example Output**  
Enter the first name: J  Enter the last name:  Enter the ZIP code: ABCDE  Enter an employee ID:  A12-1234  "J" is not a valid first name. It is too short.  The last name must be filled in.  The ZIP code must be numeric.  A12-1234 is not a valid ID.  OrEnter the first name: Jimmy  Enter the last name: James  Enter the ZIP code: 55555  Enter an employee ID:  TK-421  There were no errors found.
