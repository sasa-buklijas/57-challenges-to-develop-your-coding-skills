# From the book:

The “Hello, World” program is the first program you learn
to write in many languages, but it doesn’t involve any input.  
So create a program that prompts for your name and prints a greeting using your name.  

**Example Output**  
What is your name? Brian  
Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!
