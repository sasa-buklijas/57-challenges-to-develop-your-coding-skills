Knowing how often a word appears in a sentence or block of text is helpful for creating word clouds and other types of word analysis.  
And itâ€™s more useful when running it against lots of text.
Create a program that reads in a file and counts the frequency of words in the file.  
Then construct a histogram displaying the words and the frequency, and display the histogram to the screen.


**Example Output**  

Given the text file words.txt with this content 

     badger badger badger badger mushroom mushroom    
     snake badger badger badger
     
the program would produce the following output:  badger:   *******  mushroom: **  snake:    *
