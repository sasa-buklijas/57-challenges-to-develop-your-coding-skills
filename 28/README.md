In previous programs, you asked the user for repeated input by writing the input statements multiple times.  
But itâ€™s more efficient to use loops to deal with repeated input. 

Write a program that prompts the user for five numbers and computes the total of the numbers.

**Example Output**  
Enter a number: 1  
Enter a number: 2  Enter a number: 3  Enter a number: 4  Enter a number: 5  The total is 15.
