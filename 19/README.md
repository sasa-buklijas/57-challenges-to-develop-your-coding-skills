You’ll often need to see if one value is within a certain range and alter the flow of a program as a result.
  
Create a program to calculate the body mass index (BMI) for a person using the person’s height in inches and weight in pounds.  
The program should prompt the user for weight and height.

Calculate the BMI by using the following formula:

    bmi = (weight / (height × height)) * 703
    
If the BMI is between 18.5 and 25, display that the person is at a normal weight.  
If they are out of that range, tell them if they are underweight or overweight and tell them to consult their doctor.

**Example Output**  
Your BMI is 19.5.  You are within the ideal weight range.  
or  
Your BMI is 32.5.  You are overweight. You should see your doctor.
