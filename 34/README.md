Sometimes you have to locate and remove an entry from a list based on some criteria.  
You may have a deck of cards and need to discard one so it’s no longer in play, or you may need to remove values from a list of valid inputs once they’ve been used.  
Storing the values in an array makes this process easier.   
Depending on your language, you may find it safer and more efficient to create a new array instead of modifying the existing one.

Create a small program that contains a list of employee names.  
Print out the list of names when the program runs the first time.  
Prompt for an employee name and remove that specific name from the list of names.   
Display the remaining employees, each on its own line.  

**Example Output**  
 
There are 5 employees:  John Smith  Jackie Jackson  Chris Jones  Amanda Cullen  Jeremy Goodwin   
Enter an employee name to remove: Chris Jones       
There are 4 employees:  John Smith  Jackie Jackson  Amanda Cullen  Jeremy Goodwin
